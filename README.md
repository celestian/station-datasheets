# Station datasheets

Datasheets of stations of model railroad club KMZ Brno I.

## How to render datasheets

Just open any `xml` file in xsl-compatible browser. Remember: `xml`
files must be served with `Content-Type: "application/xml"` header, otherwise
most of the browsers will not render the `xml` properly. This is usually
not possible via local `file://...` url, so you may need proper http server.

## How to edit datasheets

Just edit `xml` files.
